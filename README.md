## Description

Crypto doesn't have to be complicated. The DefiKids platform is designed to help you and your family learn how to comfortably use crypto in your everyday life. It's designed for kids, managed by parents.

## Problem

How do you teach your children to use crypto safely and confidently.

## Our solution

- Parents create a family sandbox. They allocate funds to be used for allowance. A percentage of funds will be allocated to a staking contract in order to distribute rewards.

- Funds automatically stream to the child creating real-time cash flow.

- Children will have the ability to use De-Fi tools such as staking & time-locks. This introduces the concepts of savings, interest and compound interest.

- Funds can be allocated for the purchase of future goods and services through the use of time-locks. This ensures that children have the funds they need when they need it.

- The parent has the ability to enable full-access mode that will allow the child to withdraw funds to be used across crypto markets. By default, withdraws are sent back to the parent who can then payout the child with fiat.
