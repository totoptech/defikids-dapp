### ⭐️ Crypto for Kids, parent approved

## Why DefiKids
An empowering platform aimed at equipping the upcoming generation with De-Fi tools, tailored for youngsters and overseen by parents.

## ✨ Simplified Platform Overview:

Discover the world of cryptocurrency with ease through the DefiKids platform. This platform is designed to guide you and your family in using crypto confidently in your daily life, and it's tailored for kids while being supervised by parents.

## 💻 Common Challenge:

How do you teach your children to use crypto safely and confidently.

## ⚡ Our Approach:

Parents can establish a secure family sandbox within the platform. They allocate funds for allowances and set aside a portion for staking. This staked amount generates rewards over time.

An exciting feature is that funds automatically flow to the child, providing a real-time understanding of finances.

## 📚 De-Fi Tools for Learning:

Children gain access to valuable De-Fi tools like staking and time-locks. These tools introduce them to concepts like savings, interest, and compound interest.

Moreover, funds can be reserved for future purchases through time-locks, guaranteeing that children have funds accessible when needed.

## 💌 Empowering Parents:

Parents can activate full-access mode, enabling children to withdraw funds for use in various crypto markets. By default, withdrawals are sent to parents, who can then convert them to fiat for their children.

## 🔥Technical Architecture:

- Contracts are deployed on the Polygon network for reduced gas fees.
- Next.js powers the user-friendly frontend.
- Solidity development using Forge.
